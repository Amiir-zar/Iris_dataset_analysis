# Iris_dataset_analysis
In this mini-project, I have endeavored to explore various machine learning techniques and conduct data analysis using the Iris dataset.

### Description 
I have built various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to showcase my ability in model development.
The models that have been developed include:

* KNN
* SVC 
* DecisionTreeClassifier
* KMeans

In another File I tried to build a CNN as a classifier for our Iris-dataset. This Network Also worked with a great Accuracy.


### Dependencies

* sklearn
* Tensorflow
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* matplotlib
